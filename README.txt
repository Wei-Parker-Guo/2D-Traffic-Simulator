This is a 2D traffic simulation application with a GUI based on Java Swing.

You can find the project design in the design folder. This project is aimed to help users construct, edit and run a virtual
city traffic system to predict potential outcomes of their design. The simulator part could be further expanded to set up
realistic vehicle systems in games or management applications.

The program entry point is at main() in Menu class.

Further intentions on this project include data collection and analysis to simulate a more realistic traffic system, and
more features/building blocks for the user.
